# DetectX

**DetectX** is a project dedicated to re-implementing and training multiple foundational object detection architectures from scratch. The goal is to understand the inner workings and unique strengths of various detection models by building them from the ground up.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of DetectX are:
- To re-implement several well-known object detection architectures from scratch.
- To train and evaluate each model on relevant datasets, providing a hands-on comparison of their performance and capabilities.

## Planned Architectures

DetectX will include implementations of the following architectures:
- **Pretrained Classification CNN as a Detection Network**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
- **RetinaNet**
- **Faster R-CNN**
- **CornerNet**
- **DETR (Detection Transformer)**
